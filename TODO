CODE TODO

Add google (or open street map) map display in view page.

Email address type on email inputs.
Phone number validation on input page.

It would be nice to have some sort of route or url creation code rather than manually throwing together strings.

It would also be nice to get the data access cleaned up.

Don't show address when we don't have it.

Allow for entry of a second address for pickup? Make pickup address the first entered, and 
have a secondary for other addresses? - NOTE: just enter in "notes" for now, make data entered
the most used even if it isn't the residence or home phone number.

Add SSL for site
	Need Cert first, then can use with site

Add Script/CSS compression for production environment.

Add Meetings/classes/rosters.

SYSTEM TODO

Cron job to select users that are not enabled and email list to me.
Nginx upgrade/update config
Database backup - maybe install dropbox client and a cron job to copy the db file to the dropbox folder nightly?

Look for a different host to see if we can get away with something cheaper.
