Currently add/edit/view works for student and list of students.

Allow for entry of a second address for pickup? Make pickup address the first entered, and 
have a secondary for other addresses?

Validation on student entry form:
1. Name fields required.
2. None on phone?
3. Change state to dropdown
4. Zip must be numbers
5. Birth/salvation/baptism/first attendance must be dates

Add authentication.

Decide if I want to move to VIEWs for the individual types of people in the system.

Add filtering by user for the people displayed - don't need to see South ppl for 
someone who is in HS group. But need to allow them to expand to that, or have
a user that will have access to all.

Add stuff to deal with workers. Most of it is there with Students, need to 
determine what is different and how that should be handled.

Change so style mobile is viable. Add the stuff viewport, icon, etc. <meta> head elements.

Move to heroku? Get something setup at Xenos? Initiate that process.

Add Script/CSS compression for production environment.

Determine what to do about Templates - common file and all compiled?

Add Meetings/classes/rosters.
