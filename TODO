NOTES

Paging display doesn't work quite right 

Add google map display in view page.

Phone number validation on input page.

It would be nice to have some sort of route or url creation code rather than manually throwing together strings.

Allow for entry of a second address for pickup? Make pickup address the first entered, and 
have a secondary for other addresses? - NOTE: just enter in "notes" for now, make data entered
the most used even if it isn't the residence or home phone number.

Add Script/CSS compression for production environment.

Add Meetings/classes/rosters.
